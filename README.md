# Recruiter vs CV — Interactive Card Battle CV

A polished, Hand of Fate-inspired trading card battle game where recruiters play "objection" cards and the CV auto-counters them with "achievement" cards.

## 🎮 Concept
This project transforms a standard Senior Gameplay Programmer CV into an interactive experience. The goal is to dismantle every recruiter objection with proven technical achievements in VR, Multiplayer, and Leadership.

## ✨ Features
- **Dark Fantasy Aesthetic**: Candlelight ambience, ornate card designs, and dramatic lighting.
- **3D Card Interactions**: perspective-based tilt on hover and smooth flip transitions.
- **Procedural FX**: Particle bursts, screen shake, and ambient embers (Canvas API).
- **Web Audio SFX**: High-fidelity procedural sound effects (no external audio files needed).
- **Deck Viewer**: Explore the full CV and card collection in a dedicated modal.
- **Surrender Mechanic**: Recruiters can surrender once they are convinced.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5 / CSS3**: Vanilla implementation with modern CSS variables and 3D transforms.
- **JavaScript**: Pure ES6+ logic, no external libraries.
- **Canvas API**: For dynamic particle systems.
- **Web Audio API**: For real-time procedural sound generation.
